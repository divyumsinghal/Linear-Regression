This CUDA Runtime API sample is a very basic sample that implements element by element vector addition. It is the same as the sample illustrating Chapter 3 of the programming guide with some additions like error checking.

## Key Concepts

CUDA Runtime API, Vector Addition

## Supported OSes

Linux, Windows

## Supported CPU Architecture

x86_64, armv7l
